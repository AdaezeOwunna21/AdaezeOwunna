<p class="ebcparagraph1">
    Evelyn Cakes and Bakes is a small upcoming bakery business.<br>
    The owner specializes in making cakes, designing events, and more<br>
    for the city of Houston. She wanted to expand her presence by building<br>
    and online website.She already had an Instagram, but she also wanted to <br>
    be more known in the digital marketplace. The owner created a website but<br>
    but it wasn't gaining any traction. By redesigning her webite, more customers<br>
    flocked to the business and wanted to buy cakes and more.<br>
</p>
<h1 class="heading2">The Website Lacked Personality and Branding</h1>
<p class="ebcparagraph2">
    User feedback indicated that the website needed its own personal branding that<br>
    shows what type of business it represents. One user complained about seeing the<br>
    wood,“I wouldn’t even know that they sell cake because the first picture I see<br>
    is a piece of wood”. The website needed to feel like a cake website and show <br>
    more personality.<br>

<h1 class="heading3">Whisking Up a Delightful Cake Website</h1>
<p class="ebcparagraph3">
    The owner didn’t have a lot of content to share, so the best idea was to create<br>
    a single one-page website, that had all the user needed to know about this upcoming<br>
    cake business. The website also lacked personality, so adding pictures of cakes,<br>
    drawings, and a more playful type of font added to the user's understanding of what<br>
    the business was all about. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript the website was created.<br>

<h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<h1 class="heading4">Putting the Cherry on Top of the Finishing Touches</h1>
<p class="ebcparagraph4">
    The users loved the new designs of the website and the layout, “I love how at home,<br>
    I feel when I come across this website like my mom is baking a cake for me”. Creating<br> 
    a website that makes people feel connected to the brand is most important. With this<br>
    new interface, users understood more about the business and were more inclined to want<br>
    to work with the client.<br>
